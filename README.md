# CV Generator

A Python tool that generates a professional CV/resume in PDF format using LaTeX and the Awesome-CV template.

## Features

- Loads CV data from YAML files
- Uses Claude for content enhancement
- Generates a professional PDF using LaTeX
- Based on the Awesome-CV template

## Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- LaTeX installation with XeLaTeX
- Fonts: Lora and Fira
- Some AI key comes in handy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your API key:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key'
   ```

## Usage

1. Update your CV data in the YAML files under `data/`:
   - `carstories.yaml`: CAR stories (challenge, action, result) with skills and a job identifier
   - `education.yaml`: Educational background
   - `jobs.yaml`: Work experience with job identifier
   - `skills.yaml`: Skills and competencies
   - `headers.yaml`: Various things like phone number, mail address...
   - `languages.yaml`: The languages you speak
   - `statements.yaml`: Statements about last job positions, with job identifiers

2. Generate your CV:
   ```bash
    uv run main.py
   ```

## Changing things

### Using different AI models
PyCv uses  [`instructor`](https://python.useinstructor.com) in `ai.py`. If you want to address a different model (the code defaults to Claude), you will have to adapt `client = ...` and the parametrization of the model in the constructor and in `ask()`.

### Using different prompts and different output languages
All AI prompts are save in `pycv/*-prompt.txt`. Feel free to adapt those to your needs. The current version is in German; you might want to change that.

### Changing the layout of the PDF
While the PDF generation makes heavy use of the `awesome-cv` LaTeX template, the given version has been adapted to my needs. Most obvious are the font changes. Feel free to simply replace the given `awesome-cv.cls` version with one that suits your needs.

Some configuration (eg. color) is done in `pycv/pycv.py` with `generate_latex()`. You might want to check that out first.
